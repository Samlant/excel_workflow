## FAQ

#### Can I change which folder I can add new qouteforms to?

No, not currently.  We are planning to be able to add this eature by right-clicking on the system tray icon in the lower-right corner.  For now, you may request it from us and we'll adjust it accordingly for you.

#### How can I tell it's working?

You'll see an icon in the system tray icon in the lower-right corner. Also, when you add a file to the watched folder, a dialogue window will open.
